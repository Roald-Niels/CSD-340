    <h2>Introduction With Buttons</h2>
    <p class="intro">I was born and raised in a small town called <span id="span1">______</span> in the Netherlands. My childhood was filled with playing video games with friends and family. It was a place where everyone knew each other, creating a strong community.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I developed a passion for <span id="span3">______</span>. Whether it was picking up a new game in a store or trying out a new game at a friends house, I always found ways to keep myself entertained.</p>
    <p>I am not a fan of outdoor activities. This is due to the many allegries that I have, and where i currently live. <span id="span2">______</span> can just be to hot sometimes! 
      <span id="span4">______</span>
    </p>
    <p>Recently, I have taken an interest in web development. The idea of creating something from <span id="span4">______</span> and seeing it come to life on a screen is incredibly rewarding. This course is a step towards achieving my goal of becoming a proficient web developer.</p>
