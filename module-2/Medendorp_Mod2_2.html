    <h1>Assignment 2.2 â€“ Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro">I was born and raised in a small town called Den Helder in the Netherlands. <span class="sentence">My childhood was filled with playing video games with friends and family.</span> It was a place where everyone knew each other, creating a strong community.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I developed a passion for gaming. Whether it was picking up a new game in a store or trying out a new game at a friends house, I always found ways to keep myself entertained.</p>
    <p>I am not a fan of outdoor activities. This is due to the many allegries that I have, and where i currently live. Florida can just be to hot sometimes!</p>
    <p>Recently, I have taken an interest in web development. The idea of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life on a screen is incredibly rewarding. This course is a step towards achieving my goal of becoming a proficient web developer.</p>
